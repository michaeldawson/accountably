# Accountably
A hybrid rails / iOS app for managing finances.

### V 0.1 - Minimum viable product:

##### Budget:
I can set up a budget, with a defined cycle length, and a pay day.
I can add accounts, which hold money for things like rent, food, bills etc.
Come payday, the budget is applied to accounts, so that they're incremented by the predefined budget amount.
After creating the budget, the first payday is applied prior to today.
I can't edit someone else's budget

##### Accounts:
I can view an account, and see the balance and all transactions for that account.
I can add a new transaction, which will decrement the account.
I can edit the description of a transaction.
I can edit the amount of a transaction, which will adjust the balance of the account accordingly.
I can delete a transaction, which will adjust the balance of the account.
I can change the effective date of a transaction.
I can't edit someone else's accounts

##### Home page:
I can see how much I have in all of my accounts.
I can see my expenses for this pay cycle.
I can see if I'm on-track or tracking over budget.
